It is responsive and should be mobile friendly (not for all mobile phones). Website contains several simple pages. I learned Firebase basics during this project. Pictures can be stored in Firebase, and they would appear into the gallery instantly. ",

I learned React, Typescript basics, got to know what API is. I implemented my own questions in this project and had to familiarize myself with JSON and added right/wrong answers overview. This website contains almost no styling! ",
